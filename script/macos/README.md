This directory contains scripts and configuration files for managing fheroes on macOS:

* `Brewfile`: Defines the basic development dependencies required to build fheroes, including SDL2 and related libraries
* `Brewfile.app_bundle`: Additional dependencies needed for creating macOS application bundles
